            	  		<p>WiSense is an Android based platform being developed by the WiNGS Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for wireless debugging and diagnosis in both enterprise and home WLANs. The platform allows users to analyze the channel quality, monitor the signal quality of neighboring WLANs and detect the presence of neighboring non-WiFi activity. The ease of usage and mobility provided by handheld device platforms can allow network administrators as well as users to identify location specific wireless performance issues in their WLANs. This tool is also being developed as part of our group's efforts to collect data about wireless performance at different locations and share it with the community. </p>
						<p>So, in brief, WiSense lets you:</p>
                        <ul>
                             <li>Analyze non-WiFi neighboring activity</li>
                             <li>...</li>
                             <li>...</li>
                        </ul>
						
						<p>Please watch the small introduction video to get a feel of WiSense:</p>

              <h4>Introduction</h4>

              <p>MVC is an acronym which stands for "Model, View, Controller." It is, very simply, a methodology for separating code in an application based on its function or purpose. All of Apple's frameworks and preconfigured projects follow the MVC paradigm-- and you should, too! MVC is widely used in web development. To read more about MVC as it applies to iOS, check out Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/general/conceptual/CocoaEncyclopedia/Model-View-Controller/Model-View-Controller.html">concept page.</a></p>

                <div style="text-align: center;"> 
                  <em>MVC has many subtle implementations, this is not strictly accurate for iOS but is a fair approximation.</em>
                </div>
              </div>
              <!-- End Image -->

              <br>
              <h4>Model</h4>

              <p>MVC divides code into three partitions, the first of which is the Model. <strong>A Model represents the data, business logic, and state of the application.</strong> When creating classes that abstractly represent real-world objects that your program uses to store information or state, you are defining the Model.</p>

              <div class="alert alert-dismissable alert-success">
              <h5>Model Example</h5>
                <p>Assume for a moment that you are developing Twitter's next app in anticipation of their IPO. You could create classes called "User," "Tweets," or "Vines" that the app creates and manipulates as needed. When a new user signs up your app instantiates a new User object and saves it in a database, when users post new tweets you instantiate a new Tweet object and spread it to all of the users. All of theses classes fall into the catgory of "Model" classes. Each of them define and represent some form of data in an object-oriented fashion that your app uses to function. The Model group of objects is useful as it allows developers to seperate the app's logic code from its implementation code. </p>
              </div>

              <br>
              <h4>View</h4>

              <p>Views are objects that contain all the code that deals with displaying content to the user and allowing the user to interact with the application. </p>

              <p>Although the above description may seem a little broad its actually quite naive. Consider a more simple example: in Java command-line programs we use System.out to post strings to the user and Scanner to retrieve input. These can both be thought of as View objects in an MVC architecture.</p>

              <p>In iOS all View objects subclass UIView. These subclassed objects contain everything from buttons to labels to images and each are independantly capable of interacting with the user on their own-- you rarely need to subclass them. Just like System.out or Scanner above, you can use these objects "out of the box" to fetch or present strings (or a variety of other types of data) to the user</p>

              <div class="alert alert-dismissable alert-success">
                <h5>View Example</h5>

                <!-- this is an image and a link paired together in a well with a builtin caption -->
                <div class="well">
                  <a href="./img/lecture_1/sample_screens.png">
                    <img src="./img/lecture_1/sample_screens.png" class="img-rounded"> 
                  </a>

                  <div style="text-align: center;"> 
                    <em>Two sample screens from Chase's iPhone app.</em>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <!-- End Image -->

                <ol>
                  <li>UIButton- responsible for displaying text within their bounds, maintaining a background iamge, and forwarding touch events to a Controller</li>
                  <li>UIImageView- displays an embedded image</li>
                  <li>UITableView- retains a set of objects displayed in cells. Each cell represents an element of the set in a specified order. Tables relay touch events to Controllers like UIButtons</li>
                </ol>
              </div>

              <br>
              <h4>Controller</h4>

              <p>The Controller class of objects is responsible for managing the application's model and views. It acts as an intermediary between both and handles changes from either. Ultimately it has the highest precedence and most responsiblity in iOS.</p>

              <p>Controller objects, as the name implies, control the other two groups of objects. They literally own Views and can be associated with Models wherever necesary. When working with iOS you will spend the majority of your time creating and changing view controllers. </p>

              <p>In iOS all Controller objects subclass UIViewController and are, by conventioned, suffixed by "ViewController." For example, if you create a ViewController subclass that is responsible for managing the Home screen, you should name it HomeViewController.</p>

              <div class="alert alert-dismissable alert-success">
                <h5>Controller Example</h5>

                <!-- this is an image and a link paired together in a well with a builtin caption -->
                <div class="well">
                  <a href="./img/lecture_1/sample_screens_controllers.png">
                    <img src="./img/lecture_1/sample_screens_controllers.png" class="img-rounded"> 
                  </a>

                  <div style="text-align: center;"> 
                    <em>Same sample screens without markup. Note the differences between the two and the names of each controller as shown on the tabs on the bottom of the image.</em>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <!-- End Image -->

                <p>Each of these two images are seperate ViewControllers. Each of the images have different classes responsible for managing the different views while the app is running and each serves a different purpose.</p>
              </div>

              <br>
              <h4>Conclusion</h4>

              <p>Thanks for reading through the theory. You can forget everything you just read.</p>

              <p>I'm only half kidding! You must at least know what MVC means and what the acronym stands for. In order for you to truly take advantage of Apple's framework you have to intuitively understand the power and flexibility that MVC provides you as a programmer. If you adopt MVC conventions your code will be cleaner, more logical, and easier to debug. For now, you can simply pick it up as you follow along.</p>

              <p>In these three lectures we will focus on each different aspect of MVC while developing the app; this lecture will focus on Views.</p>

          <section id="ib">
            <div class="page-header">
              <h3>InterfaceBuilder</h3>

              <p>InterfaceBuilder (commonly abbreviated as IB) is Xcode's integrated view-building tool. It is a WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) editor that allows you to drag and drop UIViews onto the screen easily. One of the nicest features of Xcode, InterfaceBuilder allows you to deal with the View creation process without ever having to write a single line of code. </p>

              <div class="alert alert-info">
                <h5>Opening IB</h5>
                <p>All information about your app's views is stored in a *.storyboard file in the project manager. Click on it to open InterfaceBuilder.</p>
              </div>

              <p>IB can look a little complicated, but there are only a two broad kinds of items that appear on the screen.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>ViewControllers- every long rectangle on the screen represents a ViewController. These rectangles are the only things that can "float" in IB's main window</li>
                <li>Arrows- arrows in IB represent relationships between ViewControllers. The arrow on the left of the image above identifies the first ViewController to appear when the app launches. Arrows between ViewControllers are called <em>segues</em> and represent a transition between ViewControllers</li>
              </ul>

              <br>
              <h4>ViewControllers</h4>
              <p>You learned that Controllers were objects responsible for managing views and models in the MVC sections, but we didn't discuss what a ViewController really was. In iOS, ViewControllers are objects that are tasked with managing one "scene" in an application ("scene" is in quotes simply because the deliniation between ViewControllers is not always distinct.) Each ViewController typically gets the whole screen and a task; a SettingsViewController may be responsible for the settings page while a LoginViewController may authenticate the user. </p>

              <p>ViewControllers do not inherently have any knowledge of the structure of the app-- they don't know which ViewControllers came before them or started the application. To make managing many ViewControllers simpler, we use a custom ViewController called a <strong>UINavigationController.</strong> Navigation Controllers implement a stack for keeping track of ViewControllers. As a developer, you can <em>push</em> and <em>pop</em> Controllers onto the <em>Nav Stack.</em> The first ViewController in the Navigation Controller's stack is reffered to as the <em>root view controller.</em> </p>

              <!-- this is an image and a link paired together in a well with a builtin caption -->
                <div class="well">
                  <a href="./img/lecture_1/nav.jpg">
                    <img src="./img/lecture_1/nav.jpg" class="img-rounded"> 
                  </a>

                  <div style="text-align: center;"> 
                    <em>Simple example of Nav Stack usage. In this case the Settings view controller is the root controller. Touching the "General" button pushes view controller of the same name onto the stack (middle image); again with the "Auto-Lock" button (right image).</em>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <!-- End Image -->

              <div class="alert alert-info">
                <h5>Adding a ViewController to a Storyboard</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li>Make sure the storyboard is selected in the project navigator</li>
                  <li>Make sure the objects tab is selected on the bottom of the right pane</li>
                  <li>Find the item named "ViewController" and drag it onto the screen</li>
                </ol>
              </div>

              <p>This lecture is about Views, remember? We won't be coding ViewControllers in this lecture, but you have to know what they are in order to understand the structure of iOS applications. All of the types of views avaliable to you are presented in the Object Library highlighted above </p>

              <p>The view objects that you drag onto ViewControllers in InterfaceBuilder make up the "scene" for each view controller. When that ViewController is loaded in your app it loads all of the views you dragged onto it in InterfaceBuilder.</p>

              <div class="alert alert-info">
                <h5>Adding Views to a ViewController</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li>Make sure the storyboard is selected in the project navigator</li>
                  <li>Make sure the objects tab is selected on the bottom of the right pane</li>
                  <li>Double click on a view controller in InterfaceBuilder if necesary (ViewControllers can only have views added to them if they are zoomed in)</li>
                  <li>Pick a view from the list of objects and drag it onto the ViewController</li>
                </ol>
              </div>
<p>That's it for now! In the next lecture, we'll go over subclassing your own view controllers and starting the UMadInstagram project.
